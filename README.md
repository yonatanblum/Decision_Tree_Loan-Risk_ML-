# Decision_Tree_Loan-Risk_ML-


In this project I build a program that implement a decision tree 
from categorical attributes and two-class classification tasks. The programming
part requires building a tree from a training dataset and classifying unseen
instances.

The dataset comes from a risk loan dataset, which is being used to predict
the risk quality of a loan application. Each instance is classified as good (class
G) or bad(class B).
